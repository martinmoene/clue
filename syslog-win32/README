Syslog client for Windows
-------------------------

This is bare-bones client code for using syslog on Windows.

The syslog.h header file contains Windows specific information. In
particular, users of this code need to call init_syslog() prior to
calling any of the syslog functions. This limitation may be fixed in
the future.

TODO:

- Remove requirement for init_syslog().

- Make threading more efficient. As it is, all syslog calls are
  serialized. Each thread should be able to invoke syslog without
  blocking on each other.

- Add a makefile and build a library and perhaps an SxS assembly.
